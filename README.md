Optimal Touring Route for Universal Studios Hollywood

Abstract
This project focuses on optimizing the touring route for families visiting Universal Studios Hollywood. Facing limited time and high visitor traffic, it is challenging for families to experience popular attractions without enduring long waiting times or excessive fatigue. By analyzing queue times, walking distances, and attraction popularity, we employ optimization algorithms to recommend an efficient itinerary that minimizes both waiting and walking times. Our solution aims to provide practical benefits for enhancing the overall experience in a time-constrained theme park environment.
